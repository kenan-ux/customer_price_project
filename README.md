Customer Data Analysis and Visualization
Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a customer dataset, exploring relationships between demographic factors such as age, income, and spending scores. Using data from columns like CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, and Profession, the project provides insights into customer behavior and trends.

Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

numpy for numerical computations
pandas for data manipulation and analysis
os for handling file paths
seaborn and matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations
sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split) to split the data for training and testing
sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression) for building predictive models
Features
Data Visualization: Visualized correlations between factors like annual income, spending score, and work experience.
Predictive Modeling: Built a linear regression model to predict customer spending behavior based on the features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed demographic trends and customer segmentation based on spending score and family size.
